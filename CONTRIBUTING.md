# Contributing to typesafe-ts

Thank you for your interest in contributing to typesafe-ts! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masstronaut/typesafe-ts.git
   cd typesafe-ts
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**. Note that node 23.6 is required for NodeJS native TS support, which is required for the test runner.
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run typecheck
   ```

## Development Commands

- `npm run test` - Run tests with coverage
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run format` - Format all files with Biome
- `npm run format:check` - Check if files are properly formatted
- `npm run format:changed` - Format only changed files
- `npm run format:check:changed` - Check formatting for only changed files
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues automatically
- `npm run build` - Build the project
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Code Standards

### Quality Requirements

All contributions must meet these standards:

- **100% test coverage** - All code must have comprehensive tests
- **TypeScript strict mode** - All code must pass strict TypeScript checking
- **Code formatting** - All code must be formatted with Biome (enforced by pre-commit hooks and CI)
- **Eraseable syntax only** - Only _erasable_ TypeScript syntax is allowed.
- **ESLint compliance** - All code must pass linting with 0 warnings or errors
- **Zero dependencies** - Core utilities must not introduce external dependencies. Supporting code (tests, dev tools, etc.) should prefer to avoid dependencies where possible.

### Code Style

- Use strict TypeScript for all code
- Code is automatically formatted with Biome
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use JSDoc for all public interfaces
- No comments in implementation code (code should be self-documenting)
- Use monadic patterns where appropriate

### Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for consistent code formatting:

- **Automatic formatting**: Pre-commit hooks automatically format staged files
- **Manual formatting**: Run `npm run format` to format all files
- **CI validation**: Pull requests are validated for proper formatting
- **Configuration**: See `biome.jsonc` for current formatting rules

## Commit Message Format

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: Continuous integration changes
- `revert`: Reverting previous commits

### Examples

```
feat(optional): add flatMap method for chaining operations

fix(result): handle edge case in error propagation

docs: update README with new usage examples

test(optional): add comprehensive tests for filter method
```

### Scope Guidelines

- `optional`: Changes to Optional utility
- `result`: Changes to Result utility
- `lint`: Changes to ESLint or commit lint rules
- `build`: Changes to build configuration
- `ci`: Changes to CI/CD pipeline

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

   - Write code following the standards above
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Verify your changes**

   ```bash
   npm run format:check  # Check code formatting
   npm run test          # Run tests with coverage
   npm run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
   npm run lint          # ESLint checks
   npm run build         # Build the project
   npm run docs:build    # Generate documentation
   ```

   **Note**: Pre-commit hooks will automatically format your code, but you can manually check formatting with `npm run format:check`.

4. **Commit using conventional commits**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(optional): add support for linting with biome"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```

## Testing Guidelines

- All utilities must have 100% test coverage
- Tests should cover both happy paths and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests using `t.test()` nested structure
- Test some complex usage scenarios

## Adding New Utilities

When adding a new utility:

1. **Create directory structure**

   ```
   src/new-utility/
   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts            # Main implementation
   â”œâ”€â”€ new-utility.ts      # Implementation file
   â”œâ”€â”€ new-utility.test.ts # Test suite
   â””â”€â”€ readme.md           # Documentation
   ```

2. **Follow existing patterns**

   - License header at the top
   - Interface definition
   - Implementation class (frozen)
   - Factory namespace
   - Comprehensive JSDoc
   - If there are design decisions you are unsure about, open an issue or update an existing one.

3. **Update package.json exports**
   Add appropriate export paths for the new utility

## Release Process

Releases are automated using semantic-release:

- Commits to `main` branch trigger automatic releases
- Version numbers are determined by commit types
- Changelog is generated automatically
- npm publishing is handled by CI/CD

## Questions?

     * this is horrible and I wish desperately for a solution
     * but I have not found a way to constrain a type parameter to simultaneously:
     * 1. disallow types that extend true and are not exactly true - `never` and `any`
     * 2. produce a compiler error on the provided type, rather than somewhere else
     *
     * This library considers asserting either of those types to be undefined behavior:
     * - Assert<never>()   // undefined behavior
     * - Assert<any>()     // undefined behavior
     *
     * Depending on assertions for those types to compile may one day result in compiler errors
     * in a non-breaking change to this library if a way to constrain against them is found.
     * In such a case, the relevant asserts below should be updated to expect an error.
